# Giving access to parents and guardians

Parents and guardians can see and interact with their child's data through the _Parent's Dashboards_.

Their access to a student data will be tied to the email address that they used to register.

To get access to _Parent's Dashboards_ they will first need to sign up for an account using an email that they own.

#### Steps (for parents/guardians):

1. Open the _Parent's Dashboards_.
2. Click **Sign up**
3. Fill the form and click **Continue**

Note: After they finish signing up for an account, they won't have access to their child's data **until their email is assigned
as their child's guardian** by you or any member of your team on Obserfy.

## Creating a new guardian in Obserfy

To give parents/guardians access to a student's data, you'll need to assign them as the guardian of that student.

#### Steps:

1. On the _Teacher's Dashboard_, open the **Students** tab.
2. Click on the student which you would like to assign a new guardian.
3. Click on the **Profile** button.
4. Click **Add** on the _Guardians Card_
5. You can than create a new guardian or pick an existing one. Make sure the email of you set here is the same
   as the one being used by parents/guardians to login to the _Parent's Dashboards_
6. Click the **Add** button when you finish filling the form or picking a guardian

## Opening the parent's dashboards

There are a few ways for parents/guardians to open the _Parent's Dashboards_.

### Through obserfy.com

You can instruct your student's parents/guardians to open the _Parent's Dashboards_ through
[obserfy.com](https://obserfy.com) and clicking **Sign In as Parent**.

In practice, we've found that this might be a little confusing for parents/guardians since our landing page design is
targeted more towards teachers and schools.

For example, they sometimes mistakenly register to the _Teacher's Dashboard_ instead of to the _Parent's Dashboards_.

### Through your school's website.

Another option is to add a login button/link on your school's website that points to https://parent.obserfy.com directly.

Depending on the design of your website, this can be more straightforward since the context should be clearer, and the chance
of clicking the wrong button should be smaller.
