# Inviting your team

You can invite other people to join your school. This will give them full access to your teacher's dashboard. You can
invite new users and revoke their access at any time.

To invite new users, you'll need to send them an invitation link.

### Steps:

2. Enter the email addresses of the people you want to invite.
3. Click **Send Invites**

## Accepting invitation

After sending the invites, the people you invite will need to accept the invitation before they can access your school.

#### If they already have an Obserfy account

1. First, login with the existing account
2. Open the invitation link
3. Click the **Join as _"name"_** button

#### If they don't have an Obserfy account

1. Open the invitation link
2. Use the form to register for a new account

## Revoking access

You can revoke access of individual users that have joined your school. By doing this, they will lose all access to your
school's data.

#### Steps:

1. From the _Teacher's Dashboard_, open **Admin** and then click **Users**.
2. Find the user you want to remove.
3. Click on **Remove** next to their name.
