# Getting Support

We would love to hear both the needs and questions of teachers and parents. There are a few ways you can do to contact us.

## Canny

You can post and upvote feedback through our canny board. All feedback posted here will be publicly visible. We build our
product roadmap directly from feedback we got here.

You can open this by going to [feedback.obserfy.com](https://feedback.obserfy.com). Or by clicking the link on the support
page on both teacher's and parent's dashboard.

You might need to register for a canny specific account to post/upvote on our canny dashboard.

## Live Chat

We provide live chat on our websites, which you can find in the bottom right corner when you open
our website on desktop and tablets. It should show up in 3-5 seconds after the website finishes loading.

This is currently not available on mobile yet, since it is a pretty heavy feature to run on mobile devices.

## Email

You can also contact us by email through [help@obserfy.com](mailto:help@obserfy.com)
